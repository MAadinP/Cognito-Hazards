# Accelerometer code

so far there is the nios hardware and some base code

modes 0 and 1 are done - mode 1 needs uart connecting from Sean's code and I could do with some information on what the calibration needs to do from the game people for mode 2

I will get the software section so its ready for fpga testing done soon
